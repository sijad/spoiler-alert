# SPOILER ALERT

Don't spoil it! Hide copy and images with a bit of SVG blur. Taste on mouseover. Eat on click.

Do you publish spoilers? Do you wish you could have them on your page in a way that wasn't fucking rude? With Spoiler Alert!
you can! Hide spoilers with a bit of blur.

## Usage

To make your site spoiler free, simply include spoiler.js, then, add this somewhere:

```javascript
$('.spoiler').spoiler();
```

To control the maximum and partial blurs, you can pass arguments:

```javascript
$('.spoiler').spoiler({blurLevel: 10, partialBlurLevel: 4});
```
